        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p id="para1">
          Leonardo was born out of wedlock in Vinci, Italy (just outside
          Florence), and his illegitimacy prevented him from acquiring a proper
          education and from pursuing the most profitable jobs. Such
          constraints, however, never hampered (and probably even drove) da
          Vinci's hunger for knowledge and immense ambition. At the age of 15,
          da Vinci began working as an apprentice for the painter Andrea del
          Verrochio in Florence, where his artistic abilities grew, blossomed,
          and even terrified his tutor. While da Vinci had always been
          interested in innovations, it wasn't until 1482 that a change of
          environment completely released the innovator in him. Da Vinci
          relocated from Florence, traditionally regarded as Italy's cultural
          center, to Milan, a considerably more political and militaristic city,
          in search of a greater field of activity.There, da Vinci sold himself
          as a military engineer to Duke Ludovico Sforza (a successful military
          leader known as "the Dark One"). Da Vinci began inventing several of
          his renowned battle inventions in the city that "lived and died by the
          sword." Da Vinci worked for the Duke of Milan for 17 years, inventing,
          painting, sculpting, researching science, and generating an unending
          stream of creative and daring ideas. Without a doubt, da Vinci's most
          prolific time was his 17-year stay in Milan. Of course, everything
          must come to an end.

        <p id="para1">
          When the French conquered Milan in 1499, Duke Sforza was forced to
          evacuate the city. Leonardo spent the rest of his life going to
          locations like Venice and Rome to work on various projects, with a
          larger emphasis on his art (beginning on his most renowned painting,
          the Mona Lisa, in 1503) and research in anatomy (de Vinci performed
          over 30 autopsy throughout his career). Da Vinci died in 1519 at the
          age of 67, after imagining hundreds of inventions, bringing renowned
          works of art to life, and achieving achievements in a wide range of
          other subjects (from astronomy to architecture).
